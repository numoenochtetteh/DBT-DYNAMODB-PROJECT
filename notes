Why You Were Asked to Create DynamoDB Tables:
1. Storing Data in a Structured Way
Before loading data, you need to have a table structure in DynamoDB to hold the data. These tables will define how the data is organized and how it can be queried or manipulated.
Without tables, there’s no place to store the data.

2. Understanding Partition Keys (Primary Keys)
Partition Key is crucial because it uniquely identifies each item in a DynamoDB table. It's the primary means of distributing data across DynamoDB’s infrastructure. 
You need to define a partition key to ensure that each record is uniquely identifiable.

Why You Were Asked to Add Attributes:
1. Define the Structure of Data Records
In DynamoDB, attributes are the fields (columns) that hold data within each item (row). After creating the table, you need to define what kind of data each item will contain by adding attributes.
This is important for structuring the data so that it can be queried and analyzed efficiently.

# **DynamoDB and S3 Integration: Notes and Explanation**

## **Overview**
In this project, we set up a system to integrate DynamoDB with S3 to manage data effectively. The integration allows storing, organizing, and backing up data from DynamoDB tables into S3 buckets. Additionally, it enables features like Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) to safeguard DynamoDB data and maintain logs for monitoring activities.

## **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. S3 Bucket Setup**
#### **What Was Done:**
- **Created an S3 Bucket:**
  - Went to the AWS console, searched for S3, and created a bucket named (e.g., `bucket-training-123`).
  - Used default settings for simplicity.

- **Created Folders:**
  - Inside the bucket, created folders for:
    - DynamoDB tables: `dynamo/USINDSSP2020` and `dynamo/EXRATESCC2018`.
    - Logs: `logs/`.
  - Copied the S3 URI (e.g., `s3://bucket-training-123/dynamo/USINDSSP2020/`) to use it later in the project.

#### **Why Was This Done:**
- **Organization:** The folders make it easier to manage and access data.
- **Integration:** Provides a place to store data exported from DynamoDB.
- **Logs Folder:** Keeps records of actions and processes for debugging, tracking, and auditing purposes.

### **2. Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for DynamoDB Tables**
#### **What Was Done:**
- Went to DynamoDB in the AWS Console.
- Selected a table (e.g., `USINDSSP2020`).
- Enabled **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** by clicking "Edit PTIR" and checking the enable box.

#### **Why Was This Done:**
- **Data Protection:** PITR allows recovering table data to any point in the last 35 days, preventing permanent data loss from accidental deletions or corruption.
- **Reliability:** Ensures the system is robust and data is safe.

---

### **3. Logs Folder**
#### **What Was Done:**
- Created a `logs/` folder inside the S3 bucket.

#### **Why Was This Done:**
- **Tracking:** Logs help monitor system activities like data exports and imports.
- **Debugging:** If something goes wrong, logs provide error messages and details.
- **Audit Compliance:** Logs serve as a record of actions for auditing purposes.
- **Performance:** Allows analysis of system efficiency and processes.

#### **Real-Life Example:**
If a data export fails, logs can show whether it was due to permissions, file errors, or other issues. Without logs, troubleshooting becomes difficult.

## **Summary**
The integration of DynamoDB and S3 improves data management by:
- Providing a centralized storage system (S3 bucket).
- Offering reliable data recovery with PITR in DynamoDB.
- Maintaining logs for tracking, debugging, and auditing.

By following this structured approach, we ensure that our data is organized, secure, and recoverable in case of errors or failures. This setup is foundational for building scalable and robust data-driven systems.

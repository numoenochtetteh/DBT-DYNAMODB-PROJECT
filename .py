# to start the project you need to install and configure AWS CLI (AMAZON WEB SERVICES COMMAND LINE INTERFACE)
# To confirm the installation, use the 
aws --version #command at a command prompt 

#REASON FOR AWS Command Line Interface
#The AWS CLI allows you to interact with AWS services (like DynamoDB, S3, or EC2) directly from your terminal
#Configuring the CLI links your local machine to your AWS account. It ensures that your credentials (like Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) are properly set up to authenticate your action

#After that create your access key and secret key in IAM to help you interact with AWS in AWS CLI
#Open a terminal on your local machine and enter
aws configure. #Enter the access key and secret access key and  Choose a default region name
